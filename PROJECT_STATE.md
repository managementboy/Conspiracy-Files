# Conspiracy-Files — Project State

Status: **Engineering de-risk / v0.1 definition**. No feature implementation has been accepted yet.
Target: Project Zomboid Build 42; T1 verified stable Build **42.20.4**, revision **b0bbce05d5**, Steam build ID **24909800**. Other capability claims remain subject to their named spikes/research.

## Source of truth order

1. `DECISIONS.md` — current authoritative decision index.
2. `DECISIONS_BASELINE.md` — preserved full discovery history.
3. `DECISIONS_SUPERSESSIONS_2026-08-30.md` — engineering-review correction trail.
4. `ROADMAP.md` — delivery scope and gates.
5. `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_V0.2.md` — current provisional architecture.
6. `docs/research/` — observed Build 42 facts from spikes. **Observed technical reality overrides a speculative decision.**
7. `docs/decisions/` — ADRs for durable engineering choices.

## Core product

Conspiracy-Files is a solo-first Project Zomboid investigation overlay. The player survives normally and opportunistically discovers a grounded 1990s government/scientific conspiracy through ordinary PZ places and objects. There is no conventional case completion and no guaranteed final truth before death.

## Review correction

The first specification over-committed to unproven Build 42 capabilities. The engineering review dated 2026-08-30 is incorporated. Key corrections:

- a concrete v0.1 vertical slice now exists;
- no-AI is the primary experience;
- graph is v2;
- content packs, retrofit, migration and multiplayer are out of v1;
- full diagnostics are debug/development only;
- v0.1 uses hand-curated/hardcoded story locations;
- six critical spikes gate core implementation, with four additional probes required before broader v1 architecture sign-off;
- the domain core must be PZ-free/testable under Lua 5.1;
- the runtime budget remains provisionally ≤2 ms/frame outside initialization; completed T1 makes ≤500 KB/save the hard v0.1 canonical-state budget.

## Completed de-risking

- **T1 ModData persistence/size limits:** complete. The live single-player save/reload matrix on Build 42.20.4 revision b0bbce05d5 (Steam build ID 24909800) validated vanilla Lua Global ModData within the hard ≤500 KB/save canonical-state budget and established mandatory recursive pre-save validation. See `docs/research/T1_MODDATA_PERSISTENCE.md`.

## v0.1 vertical slice

One built-in hand-authored thread:
- 6 documents;
- 3 identities;
- 1 organisation;
- 2 locations;
- 1 anchor + 1 fallback;
- chronological notebook journal + evidence list;
- manual Mark Interesting;
- hardcoded/curated locations;
- no graph, theories, runtime AI, content packs, retrofit, migration, or MP.

## Immediate work

Before implementation architecture is signed off:

1. run T9;
2. run T2–T5;
3. maintain the hand-authored fixture in `test/fixtures/THREAD-001-DEAD-AIR.md`;
4. update decisions from each observed result;
5. run T7/T8/T10 before expanding native asset/location/UI assumptions; T6 only matters if retrofit is revived.

## Rule for disproven decisions

Do not preserve a decision merely because it was previously marked settled. If a spike disproves it, supersede it explicitly in `DECISIONS.md`, link the spike/issue, and add the replacement ruling.
