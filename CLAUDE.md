## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

Rules:
- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `tools/docscrape/graph_refresh.sh` (not plain `graphify update .`) to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost). Plain `graphify update .` drops the Project Zomboid Javadoc nodes; the script re-merges them.
- For Project Zomboid Java API lookups (classes, methods, inheritance), `graphify query "<question>" --graph graphify-out/pz-javadocs-graph.json` always works, even if the combined graph lost the Javadoc nodes. Rebuild that file with `python3 tools/docscrape/pz_javadocs_to_graph.py`.
